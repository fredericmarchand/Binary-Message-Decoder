These are the tests I have ran for assignment 3:


Test ran with data.txt:
First off the stream of 0's and 1's is printed to make sure it is correct
Then the program starts and the transmission starts
The IP address is printed according to the first 4 bytes of the data file that follow STX
Then a short message is printed following those bytes and that is followed by ETX
Finally the number of ones if counted in the text and it is compared to the expected number of ones in the data stream
If the 2 numbers dont match 'Error In Transmission' get outputted
Finally the transmission ends followed by the program ending
----------------------------------
0000001001111111010000000001011000011011010010000100010101001100010011000100111100000011000000000001000000000100

The program has started

The transmission has started
The IP address is 127.64.22.27
The message is "HELLO"

The number of ones is 18
The expected number of ones is 16
Error In Transmission


The transmission has ended
The program has ended
-----------------------------------
Explanation: The point of this test was to verify if the checksum comparison was 
not correct if the error message would get outputted





Test ran with data2.txt:
First off the stream of 0's and 1's is printed to make sure it is correct
Then the program starts and the transmission starts
The IP address is printed according to the first 4 bytes of the data file that follow STX
Then a short message is printed following those bytes and that is followed by ETX
Finally the number of ones if counted in the text and it is compared to the expected number of ones in the data stream
If the 2 numbers dont match 'Error In Transmission' get outputted, in this case the numbers match
Finally the transmission ends followed by the program ending
----------------------------------
000000101001100001010111001010000001100001100111011010010110110101101101011001010011000100110000001100000010010100000011000000000010001100000100

The program has started

The transmission has started
The IP address is 152.87.40.24
The message is "gimme100%"

The number of ones is 35
The expected number of ones is 35

The transmission has ended
The program has ended
---------------------------------
Explanation: This test case is was used to check if the program would work correctly with 
more digits in the data file. Also, different numbers were used for the ip address.
This case was also used to check is the program would work correctly with the correct checksum used.

Everything works like a charm, if you want to try different tests you can use the following in the given order

STX: 00000010
Add ones where you want for the IP address: 00000000000000000000000000000000 (4 bytes)
Then make your message as short or long as you want: 00000000 (8 bits) or 0000000000000000 (16 bits)
							 or 000000000000000000000000 (24 bits), etc
ETX: 00000011
checksum (put the right number or the right number of one in the text): 0000000000000000 (16 bits)
EOT: 00000100
