Comp2003 Assignment 3

Files submitted:
a3.asm
data.txt
data2.txt
io.mac
io.o
Makefile
README.txt
Tests.txt

I have made a makefile for this assignment, therefore call 'make' to compile on the lambdas
To run the program call ./a3<data.txt or ./a3<data2.txt
data.txt is the textfile that was handed to us for the assignment
data2.txt is a textfile that I have made for testing purposes
The data file cannot have too many digits in it because io.mac only picks up a certain number of them. I set it to 200.
